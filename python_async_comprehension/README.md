### What is asyncio?
 Explain the difference between a coroutine and a regular function.  Provide an example of a coroutine that demonstrates the difference. 
         Note: Incorporate the use of async and await keywords in your explanation.
         Note: Include at least two examples of coroutines in your explanation.

### What is a task?
 Explain the concept of a task in asyncio.  Provide an example of a task that demonstrates the concept.
         Note: Include at least two examples of tasks in your explanation.


### What is the difference between asyncio and threads?

   Explain how each can be used to achieve a specific goal, and provide an example of when each would be more appropriate than the other.
        For example if  you want to run multiple tasks simultaneously, asyncio is more appropriate than threads.  If you want to run a task that takes a long time to complete, threads are more appropriate than asyncio.

### What is the difference between asyncio and multiprocessing? 

   Explain how each can be used to achieve a specific goal, and provide an example of when each would be more appropriate than the other.
        For example if  you want to run multiple tasks simultaneously, multiprocessing is more appropriate than asyncio.  If you want to run a task that takes a long time to complete, multiprocessing is more appropriate than asyncio.
